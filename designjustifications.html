<p>The flow diagram shows that the main page contains a navigation, with 5 pages about Breda Tunes and 1 page about the design justifications.
The navigation ensures that all pages can be reached.
Each page shows which 'column grid' has been used. All pages are responsive, so they can be used on all desktop sizes and mobile phones.

You can also see where special features have been used, such as different buttons and a carousel.</p>

The text 'HOME' can be changed to another title. So that it piques the interest of the users of the website to discover the whole website, instead of just the home page.

A CALL TO ACTION to buy tickets is required! After seeing this website, it is important that tickets can be purchased immediately.
<br>

More information may be given about the artists. Now you only see the name, but it is interesting to know what their expertise is.

On this page of the website it is also interesting to show the 'MAP' of the festival site. This is something visitors want to know when they look at the website, so that they know where the artists are performing and where they can park the car, for example.</p>

Someone gave the tip to show star reviews on this page of the website, so that visitors can see at a glance whether the festival is well appreciated or not.

With the piece 'YOU AS OUR PHOTOGRAPHER' it is interesting to show more than 1 photo, so that visitors can see what kind of photos they can submit.</p>

<p>For the design of the website, the photos taken at the Jazz festival have been carefully considered. A photo is taken as inspiration, where the colors are taken from. These colors form the basis for the entire website and they convey the atmosphere of the Jazz festival well.
<br>
<br>
	
	The colors ensure that the studio lights of the Jazz performance form the basis for the website.
			   <br>
			   <br>
	   The fonts used are all easy to read. They match the simplistic design of the website and give it a professional look.
<br>
<br>
<br>

USER TESTING OUTCOMES (DESIGN)
	<br>
<br>
	
When testing the prototype, I clearly asked what the preferences were according to the participants regarding the design.
9 out of 10 participants indicated that they find it very important that the text is legible. They did not have to use an elegant font, but clear letters.
<br>
<br>
Following the testing of the prototype, 10 of the 10 participants thought that the atmosphere of the Jazz festival had come to the fore. The light colors used in the background show that the festival takes place during the day. The pink and purple colors show the atmosphere of the Jazz festival. These colors, in combination with the photos of the artists and the studio lights, show what is happening on stage.</p>

		  	 <h2 class="lineup">USER TESTING REPORT</h2>
<p>Test participants: 20 people
<br>
<br>
Methods:
<br>
I used my paper prototype to test the website. Due to the current Corona situation, I have asked my own family and my in-laws to participate in this User Test.
Each person received the paper prototype and started testing on the basis of this prototype. They 'thought out loud' about which functions they would use and which functions they would not use.
As soon as they wanted to press a button, I gave them the paper page they would land on when pressing this button. The same goes for switching pages within the navigation menu.
<br>
<br>
Despite being a paper prototype, very valuable feedback was provided. The feedback was mainly useful in terms of content. The participants gave a lot of good tips on how it can become even more interesting for visitors to the website. Examples include adding extra text or, for example, the floor plan.
<br>
<br>
In total, two tests were performed per participant.
The first test had already passed with some participants. They were satisfied with the website and had little or no feedback.
The test was also successful with other participants, but they also gave a lot of feedback.
According to 1 participant, the prototype was unclear.
<br>
<br>
During the second test, everyone (including the dissatisfied participant) was satisfied with the website. After the first time testing, all feedback has been adjusted. This final version is now available on this website.
<br>
The specific feedback can be read on and below the prototype. This can be found at the top of this page, called: 'First Prototype (including feedback).

<p>
Emotional/personal information
<br>
<br>
What can be clearly concluded from the test results is that the visitors / testers of the website would like to read more 'behind the scenes' information on the website.
The feedback shows that, for example, more information can be given about the artists and their expertise, about the map and the places where the artists will perform and about the staff and their motivation to work at Breda Tunes.
			   <br>
			   <br>
Call to action
<br>
<br>
A very important feedback that has been given is about the 'call to action'. Two aspects that kept coming up are the buttons. A button that leads to 'contact us'. This is important to put on every page, so that all questions visitors have can be answered immediately.
In addition, the button 'tickets' has also been added to the homepage. A lot is told there about the next spring edition of the jazz festival. Visitors can become interested in reading this, which is why a 'ticket' button is very important to generate sales.
