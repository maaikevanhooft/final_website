<p>For the design of the website, the photos taken at the Jazz festival have been carefully considered. A photo is taken as inspiration, where the colors are taken from. These colors form the basis for the entire website and they convey the atmosphere of the Jazz festival well.
<br>
<br>
	
	The colors ensure that the studio lights of the Jazz performance form the basis for the website.
			   <br>
			   <br>
			   <br>
	<br>
	<br>
			   The fonts used are all easy to read. They match the simplistic design of the website and give it a professional look.</p>
